Abstract

Genome-wide association studies of physical-activity traits have mapped numerous loci, yet the molecular mechanisms through which exercise influences human biology remain poorly defined. Progress has been hampered by the dominance of heritability-driven signals, fragmented single-omic analyses, and the absence of integrative frameworks that connect genetic associations to causal, system-level pathways.
Here we present the first deep-learning multi-omic framework for exercise genomics, combining efficiency-based causal inference with self-supervised graph representation learning and experimental validation. We introduce an exercise-specific Trait Efficiency Layer (TEL), inspired by recent frameworks quantifying trait importance and trait specificity, which provides an interpretable measure of how strongly—and how selectively—each gene contributes to exercise-related molecular variation. Exercise TEL was computed using linkage disequilibrium–aware Mendelian randomisation with accelerometer-derived vigorous activity as the exposure and four molecular layers as outcomes: plasma proteomics, CpG methylation, single-cell transcriptomics, and plasma glycomics.
To unify these heterogeneous layers, we trained a self-supervised (SSL) graph neural network (GNN) to learn exercise-responsive molecular structure without requiring labelled phenotypes. Integration with ageing biology, using differentially methylated regions from four epigenetic ageing clocks (Horvath, Hannum, DunedinPACE, PhenoAge) and first principal component (PC1) features from proteomic ageing clocks, revealed a shared network of exercise-ageing genes enriched for glycan branching, redox signalling, metabolic buffering, and DNA repair. Automated functional annotation showed that roughly one quarter of exercise–ageing genes encode redox enzymes (metalloproteases and oxidoreductases) and another quarter represent metabolite interconversion enzymes, representing unbiased enrichment of stress adaptation pathways.
Finally, we performed targeted biological validation in humans, demonstrating acute exercise-induced shifts in plasma core fucosylation and agalactosylation—confirming glycomic remodelling predicted by the TEL GNN framework.
Together, this work establishes a deep-learning, multi-omic architecture of exercise-responsive biology in humans and identifies actionable regulators that couple habitual physical activity to immunometabolic resilience and healthy-ageing trajectories.
