Abstract

Genome-wide association studies of physical-activity traits have mapped numerous loci, yet the molecular mechanisms through which exercise influences human biology remain poorly defined. Progress has been hampered by the dominance of heritability-driven signals, fragmented single-omic analyses, and the absence of integrative frameworks that connect genetic associations to causal, system-level pathways. Here we present the first deep learning multi-omic framework for exercise genomics, combining causal inference, topology, protein structure, and function with supervised Graph Attention Network (GAT) and experimental validation. We performed linkage disequilibrium–aware Mendelian randomisation using accelerometer-derived vigorous physical activity as the exposure and four omic layers as outcomes: plasma proteomics, blood CpG methylation, blood single-cell transcriptomics, and plasma glycomics. GAT prioritised exercise-responsive genes involved in glycosylation, redox and inflammatory signalling. and metabolism, as well as transcription factors, kinases, RNA-binding factors, and chromatin regulators. Pathway annotation and integration with ageing biology using differentially methylated regions and principal component features from five biological ageing clocks (Horvath, Hannum, DunedinPACE, PhenoAge, Proteomic Clock) revealed a shared network involving autophagy, oxidative stress, DNA damage response, hormonal and neuroendocrine signalling. Finally, we performed a biological validation in humans for glycomic markers, demonstrating acute vigorous exercise-induced shifts in plasma glycosylation—confirming glycomic remodelling predicted by the GAT framework. Together, this work establishes a deep learning, multi-omic architecture of exercise-responsive biology in humans and identifies actionable regulators that couple habitual physical activity to immunometabolic resilience and healthy ageing trajectories.
